Solving OOPs problem
Coding Platform-HACKERRANK


Problem Statements:
A Java interface can only contain method signatures and fields. The interface can be used to achieve polymorphism. In this problem, you will practice your knowledge on interfaces.

You are given an interface AdvancedArithmetic which contains a method signature int divisor_sum(int n). You need to write a class called MyCalculator which implements the interface.

divisorSum function just takes an integer as input and return the sum of all its divisors. For example divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6, so divisor_sum should return 12. The value of n will be at most 1000.

Read the partially completed code in the editor and complete it. You just need to write the MyCalculator class only. Your class shouldn't be public.

Sample Input

6
Sample Output

I implemented: AdvancedArithmetic
12
Explanation

Divisors of 6 are 1,2,3 and 6. 1+2+3+6=12.

Solution Explanation:
In this problem i have assign a task to implement interface .i have to create a class of Name MyCalculator which implement the interface and i have to complete the methods int divisor(int N) which takes input N as retur sum of its divisor as result as solved.
